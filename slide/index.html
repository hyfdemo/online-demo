				  <span class="title">The best</span>
				  The offspring of a customized orbiter, Oïkostem arose as the best balanced
				  home for our plans. So we submitted to its conditions.

				<span class="title">Prototype</span>
				Oïkostem's deep impulse flow is selectively regulated by a molecule
				originated in the prototype model, that creates its own variational
				principles, as oriented by the first local generation of terminable androids.

				  <span class="title">Has been reduced</span>
				  Paired hosts come out nicely after only two cycles now. Their size has been
				  reduced to a half the original as planned, and indeed they show an
				  evolutionary advantage in the process of fixing self-generated instructions.
				  Plus, they are beautiful.

				<span class="title">By close-alikes</span>
				Now I have regained hopes in someday finding myself surrounded by
				close-alikes to us. However, they will not be audible, at least not in my
				life span. We resolved the low freq vibration a superior solution for our
				communicational goals ...

				  <span class="title">To bear</span>
				  We did not expect their surface to produce such a carbon powder coat, though
				  this is the best model so far. I shall have to bear with the inconveniences.
				  They seem to establish a parallel communication through that carbon coat and
				  I find myself unable to decodify the signal into anything meaningful.

				  <span class="title">The zero level</span>
				  Today a set of vibration came up from the zero level;  we expect to launch
				  the transitional program in no longer than five basetime units. Psykesoma?				  galore and we'll betray our very nature into infinite, unending 2D surfaces.
				  We do need that vibration, and we will conquer its source.

				  <span class="title">Beautifully</span>
				  To keep my sanity I wear the tactile sensors all the time. They translate
				  beautifully; I can even see distances while still on Psykesoma. This was
				  quite a discovery. We have grown more adaptable than expected.

				  <span class="title">Uneasy to match</span>
				  Yewoona had to travel farther and longer than I did. Her base orbiter was
				  set to keep a complex combinational path that made it uneasy to match our
				  circuits. But her nature showed stronger than programmed.

				  "Blood is dark red, iron dark blue, this tale is blissful and so are you". I
				  should get to the hotel at soonest. The agency guy must be there already,
				  with some luck we'll have some nice dinner on him. How's that?
